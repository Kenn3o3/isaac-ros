# Publishing Cameraâ€™s Data

[Reference](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/ros2_tutorials/tutorial_ros2_camera_publishing.html#isaac-sim-app-tutorial-ros2-camera-publishing)

## Setup VSCode Coding Environment

In Isaac Sim, click on Window > Extensions and enable `omni.isaac.vscode` extension.

Then click on Window > VS Code to open the Isaac Sim folder in a VS Code application.

Source the terminal with:
```
export ISAACSIM_PATH="${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-4.0.0"
export ISAACSIM_PYTHON_EXE="${ISAACSIM_PATH}/python.sh"
```
You can also put the above two lines at the end of ~/.bashrc so you would not need to source everytime you open a new terminal.
